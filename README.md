# `variant-set`

`variant-set` is a Rust library that provides a set-like data structure for enum variants.
It allows you to store at most one value for each variant of an enum, providing efficient storage and retrieval based on enum variants.

See the [variant-set README.md](./variant-set/README.md) for more information.
